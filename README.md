Multitarget Optimizing Brainfuck Compiler

This compiler is implemented in Java, and currently targets Java. The code-emitting backend is pluggable, and can be extended by implementing <code>com.drellem.bf.emit.Emitter</code> to add support for different language targets. Development is in progress!
